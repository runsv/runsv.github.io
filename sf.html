<h2>Seriously, it takes minimal fucking effort to improve this shit</h2>

<p>
<strong>Indeed it just took us a few fucking declarations.</strong>
</p>

<p>
That's how much CSS it took to turn that
<a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">grotesque pile of shit</a>
into this easy-to-read masterpiece. It's so fucking simple and it
<em>still</em> has all the glory of the original perfect-ass website:
</p>

<ul>

<li>
Shit's <em>still</em> lightweight and loads fast
</li>

<li>
<em>Still</em> fits on all your shitty screens
</li>

<li>
<em>Still</em> looks the same in all your shitty browsers
</li>

<li>
The motherfucker's <em>still</em> accessible
to every asshole that visits your site
</li>

<li>
Shit's <em>still</em> legible and gets your fucking point across
</li>

</ul>

<h3>And guess what, motherfucker:</h3>

<p>
You never knew it, but it's easy to improve readability on your site.
Here's how.
</p>

<h2>Let it breathe</h2>

<p>
Look at lines 1 and 2 of some shitty website you're building.
Assuming they're not married they probably shouldn't be humping.
The defaults are trash -- pick a minimum <code>line-height: 1.4</code>
for body copy. Headings should be tighter.
If you can't see that ... piss off.
</p>

<p>
If your text hits the side of the browser, fuck off forever.
You ever see a book like that? Yes? What a shitty book.
</p>

<h2>A little less contrast</h2>

<p>
Black on white? How often do you see that kind of contrast in real life?
Tone it down a bit, asshole. I would've even made this site's background
a nice <code>#EEEEEE</code> if I wasn't so focused on keeping declarations
to a lean 7 fucking lines.
</p>

<h2>Size Matters</h2>

<p>
I know your partner says otherwise, but it's true.
Bump that body copy to render close to 16px or more.
Smaller type works well for print, not the screen.
</p>

<h2>Line-width, motherfucker</h2>

<p>
Looking at an LCD screen is strainful enough.
Don't make me read a line of text that's 200 fucking characters long.
Keep it to a nice 60-80 and users might actually read more than one
sentence of your worthless dribble.
</p>

<h3>Yes, this is <em>satire</em>, you fuck</h3>

<p>
I love what the creator of
<a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">this site's inspiration</a>
did. What I'm saying is that it's so, so simple to make sites easier to read.
Websites are broken by default, they are functional, high-performing,
and accessible, but they're also fucking ugly.
You and all the other web designers out there need to make them not total shit.
